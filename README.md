# 🔧 Installation & Usage
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Acchu364/SimpleQuiz.git  
cd SimpleQuiz
```

Open index.html in your browser.

Answer the quiz questions as they appear.

At the end, view your score and feedback.

# ✅ How it Works
The JavaScript logic loads the quiz questions (either embedded or via an external file)

It presents each question and its multiple-choice options to the user

The user selects an answer, moves to the next question (or automatically proceeds)

At the end of all questions, the script computes the total correct answers and presents the score

Optionally you could extend it to include timers, question shuffle, user input for name, etc.

# 🎨 Customisation & Extension Ideas
Here are some ways you could enhance or expand this project:

Add question categories (e.g., Maths, Science, History) with user selection

Introduce a timer per question or for the entire quiz

Allow randomisation of question order and option order

Keep track of high scores in local storage or a backend

Make the quiz dynamic, loading questions from an external JSON or API

Add feedback per question (show explanation after answer)

Support progressive difficulty, unlock levels, or change themes for UI

Add a dark mode or visually enhanced styling for premium look
